TODO:

Menu:
	Add an Add Student tab for Class Menu
	IE look at Menu(currClass, curr) and create(title) for info
	look at the create Account else statement in create(title)
	Would need to create global variable for TextFields that read Student data

	Change Grades for Class Menu and put it into a view box.. like for view Class/view Quiz

Database:

	View function:
		List all classes for user (search for classList)
		also be able to load the class selected in the mouselistener following classList initialization
		List all quizzes for user (search for quizList)
		also be able to load the class selected in the mouselistener following classList initialization

	Create User(s)/Class(es):
		I was thinking that utility logic should add any class added to ALL Admins.
		AND I figure that any admin created should have ALL classes add to their class array

	Grades (once figured out):
		Should take a student or the roster of students to send each student to the recursive grades func 
		that would print each quiz grade (and possibly the cummalitive w/ a NEW label to the right of the students name. 

	Password Change:
		Change the utility function to return a boolean instead of void. We need to know if the change was successful to 
		change the error lbl appropriately... Function in Menu is there just need utility change.


	QuizFrame:
		logic to save Quiz in Quiz() function
		logic to open each question in takeQuiz() function

		Open/Save Question
		Open/Save Answers
		Read radioButtons from takeQuiz to save student answers
		Radio Buttons

				

Test:
	create User(s); remove comments under Create Account event under actionChanged func
	create Class(es); remove comments under Create Class event under actionChanged func

	(Add to Phase 3 Testing?)
	Add logic to check empty text boxes. When a string is allocated for a TextField/PassField/TextArea
	in the event handlers we need to check if a string is "" then throw an error in the errorLbl. We need
	to make sure there is nothing created or added that has a string of ""

	Add logic where creating a quiz if a radio button is selected on an empty textfield that it throws an error
	and doesn't continue to the next question
